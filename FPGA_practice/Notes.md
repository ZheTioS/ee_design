# Notes from FPGA Design for embedded systems

## Week 1
- A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing hence field programmable.
- The FPGA configuration is generally specified using Hardware Description Language (HDL) and this is similar to that used for an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).
- An Application Specific Standard Product (ASSP) is a semiconductor device product dedicated to a specific application market and sold to more than one user.
